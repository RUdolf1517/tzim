# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The v0.1 code is complete and tested in CI, but no release artifacts have been published yet. Planned
releases are described in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

### Added

- **PNG handler.** IDAT recompression with `zlib -9`, scanline filter re-selection for non-interlaced,
  non-animated images, optional Zopfli. Every non-IDAT chunk is copied byte for byte, including unknown and
  private chunks. Verification re-parses the candidate (all chunk CRCs) and decodes both files row by row
  with the independent `png` crate.
- **gzip handler.** The header (`FEXTRA`, `FNAME`, `FCOMMENT`, `FHCRC`, `MTIME`, `XFL`, `OS`) is preserved
  verbatim; only the DEFLATE body is rewritten and the trailer is copied after proving it matches.
  Multi-member files and trailing data are refused.
- **Safe replacement.** Temporary file created next to the destination with `create_new`, RAII cleanup,
  permission and timestamp preservation, `fsync`, single `rename`, directory `fsync` on Unix, and detection
  of concurrent modification before the swap.
- **CLI.** `optimize`, `formats`, `--help`, `--version`; multiple files, directories, `--recursive`,
  `--dry-run`, `--jobs`, `--json`, `--quiet`, `--fail-fast`, `--include`, `--exclude`, `--min-size`,
  `--max-size`, `--max-pixels`, `--zopfli`, `--follow-symlinks`, `--allow-hardlinks`,
  `--allow-root-ownership-change`, `--no-fsync`. Exit codes `0`–`4`.
- Deterministic output ordering, de-duplication by `(device, inode)`, symlink and hard-link refusal.
- 41 unit tests and 21 integration tests; CI on Linux, macOS and Windows; clippy `-D warnings`; static musl
  build with a measured size of 832 KiB and 14 dependency lines.
